Distributed Computing
This week you need to implement distributed computing via remote procedure call (RPC), which has similiar interface you get with real robot via PyNaoQi.

The server and client have to be implemented together:

ServerAgent provides remote RPC service;
ClientAgent requests remote call from server and provides non-blocking capibility.
