## Introduction

This project focuses on creating intuitive and effective methods for humans to interact with robots using programming. It encompasses various aspects such as gesture recognition, voice commands, and real-time feedback to facilitate seamless communication between humans and robots.

## Features

* Gesture Recognition: Implement algorithms to detect and interpret human gestures using 
  computer vision.
* Voice Commands: Integrate speech recognition for controlling robots through voice commands.
* Real-Time Feedback: Provide immediate feedback to users through visual and auditory cues.
* Simulation Environment: Create a simulation environment to test and refine interaction 
  techniques.
* Extensive Documentation: Comprehensive guides and tutorials to help users understand and 
  utilize the project.

## Installation
